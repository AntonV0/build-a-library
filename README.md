# Build a Library
## Project #37 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This project is centered around JavaScript classes, allowing a fictional library to add and modify its contents. The parent class "Media" has three subclasses - "Book", "Movie", and "CD". Each of these subclasses have their specific properties with getters, along with three methods - getAverageRating(), toggleCheckoutStatus(), and addRating().
## What I Learned
  - Common JavaScript class syntax
  - Constructor functions to initialise an object instance of a class
  - Class inheritance using the "extends" keyword
  - Passing down methods, getters, and setters from the parent class to subclasses
